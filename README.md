I'm a software developer who has spent the last several years working on the back end for AWS Elemental MediaConnect. During that time I implemented new customer facing features such as content quality analysis. Behind the scenes I developed a robust intagration testing system, as well as simplified and expanded infrastructure as code pipelines.
