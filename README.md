I'm Robert Sandfield, a current student in computer science looking to graduate in December. I've leaned slightly into cloud development in my choices for classes and school projects, although everything code and design is interesting to me. I started dabbling in code back in high school, when I tried making Minecraft mods. Since then I've toyed around with physics simulation in Unity and eventually got into my current post-bacc degree program after realizing I was getting far more satisfaction out of my hobby than my job.
